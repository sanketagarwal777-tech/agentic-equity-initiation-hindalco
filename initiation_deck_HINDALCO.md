## Slide 2: Company Overview
**Hindalco Industries: A Global Metals Major**

*   **Structure**: Flagship metals company of the Aditya Birla Group (USD 26bn turnover).
*   **Key Segments**:
    1.  **Novelis (Subsidary)**: ~60-65% of EBITDA. Global leader in Flat Rolled Products (FRP) and recycling. Operations in NA, EU, Asia, SA.
    2.  **Aluminium Upstream (India)**: Bauxite mining -> Alumina -> Smelting (1.3MT capacity). Lowest cost quartile globally.

## Slide 3: Industry Structure & Positioning
**Favorable Supply-Demand Dynamics**

*   **Global Aluminium Market**:
    *   **Supply Constraint**: China production cap (45MT) and high energy costs in Europe limit new capacity.
    *   **Deficit Outlook**: Market expected to be in deficit in 2025-26 as green demand (Solar, EV) accelerates.
    *   **LME Prices**: Forecasted to remain firm ($2,600-$2,900/t), supporting upstream margins.
*   **Competitive Positioning**:
    *   **Vs. Vedanta**: Hindalco has lower corporate governance risk and better leverage profile.
    *   **Vs. Tata Steel**: Less exposure to volatile European steel markets.
    *   **Vs. NALCO**: Superior value-addition capabilities (Downstream vs. Pure commodity).

## Slide 7: Trading Comps Analysis
**Valuation Relative to Peers**

| Company | Mkt Cap (₹ Cr) | EV/EBITDA (x) | P/E (x) | Remarks |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Hindalco** | 2,17,138 | **8.0x** | **12.1x** | Best-in-class integrated player |
| Vedanta | 269,836 | 7.8x | 18.6x | Higher yield, higher risk |
| Tata Steel | 259,907 | 6.8x | 28.3x | Deep cyclical discount |
| JSW Steel | 306,024 | 14.2x | 40.7x | Premium for growth execution |

*   **Commentary**: Hindalco trades at a discount to downstream-focused peers but a premium to pure commodity plays. Given its transition to a downstream-heavy portfolio (Novelis), a re-rating towards 9-10x EV/EBITDA is justified.

## Slide 8: Scenario Analysis
**Risk-Reward Profile**

| Scenario | Target Price | LME ($/t) | Assumptions |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Bull Case** | **₹1,350** | >$3,000 | Accelerated Bay Minette execution, Strong Global Auto demand. |
| **Base Case** | **₹1,150** | ~$2,600 | Steady execution, Stable margins (14%), GDP-linked volume growth. |
| **Bear Case** | **₹850** | <$2,200 | Global recession, Capex overrun >10%, Margin contraction. |

*   **Conclusion**: Asymmetric risk-reward; Upside potential significantly outweighs downside risks.

## Slide 9: Key Catalysts
**Triggers for Re-Rating**

1.  **Bay Minette Commissioning (2H CY2026)**: Successful completion will alleviate capex concerns and start contributing to volume/cash flow.
2.  **Novelis IPO Revival**: While paused, a potential listing in FY27 could unlock value and reduce holding company discount.
3.  **Deleveraging Milestone**: Achieving Net Debt/EBITDA < 1.0x would position it as a fortress balance sheet, potentially leading to higher dividend payouts.
4.  **China Stimulus**: Any significant stimulus in China boosting metal demand.

---

## Slide 10: Key Risks
**What Could Go Wrong?**

*   **Macro Headwinds**: Global recession impacting demand for cans (Novelis) and autos.
*   **Capex Escalation**: Further cost blowouts at Bay Minette (already rose from $2.5bn to ~$5bn) could drag free cash flow.
*   **LME Volatility**: Sharp fall in aluminium prices hurts the unhedged portion of India upstream profitability.
*   **Regulatory**: Carbon taxes (CBAM) in Europe affecting exports (though Novelis recycling focus mitigates this).

## Slide 11: Final Recommendation
**HINDALCO: Buy for Quality & Growth**

*   **Recommendation**: **BUY**
*   **Investment Horizon**: 12-18 Months
*   **Valuation Snapshot**:
    *   CMP: ₹964
    *   **Target: ₹1,150**
    *   Implied Multiple: 9.0x FY27E EV/EBITDA
*   **Bottom Line**: Hindalco offers a rare combination of offensive growth (Novelis expansion) and defensive resilience (Low leverage, steady India cash flows). It remains a top pick in the global metals space.
