## 1. Investment Thesis

**"Resilient Integrated Model with High-Growth Downstream Optionality"**

We initiate coverage on Hindalco Industries with a **BUY** rating and a Target Price of **₹1,150**, implying a ~19% upside from current levels. Our thesis is predicated on three key pillars:

1.  **Novelis - The Crown Jewel**: Novelis remains the world’s largest producer of rolled aluminium and a leader in beverage can and automotive sheet recycling. Despite recent capital cost escalations at the Bay Minette project, the long-term structural demand for sustainable, recycled aluminium packaging and automotive lightweighting remains intact. The eventual commissioning of Bay Minette (expected 2H CY2026) will significantly boost EBITDA/tonne and volume growth.
2.  **India Operations - Strong Cash Cow**: The domestic aluminium and copper businesses are highly profitable, providing stable cash flows to fund global expansion. India’s focus on infrastructure and renewable energy drives domestic aluminium demand, where Hindalco holds a dominant position.
3.  **Deleveraged Balance Sheet**: Hindalco has successfully deleveraged over the last few years, achieving a Net Debt/EBITDA ratio of well under 2.0x. This financial discipline allows it to weather commodity cycles better than peers like Vedanta tailored for high dividend payouts or Tata Steel dealing with European volatility.

**Key Catalyst**: Completion of the Bay Minette expansion and a potential revival of the Novelis IPO plans in FY27 could unlock significant value.

## 3. Industry Overview & Competitive Landscape

### Global Aluminium
*   **Supply/Demand**: The global market is shifting towards a deficit in 2025-26 as demand from green energy (solar, EVs) outpaces supply, constrained by Chinese production caps (45MT) and high energy costs in Europe.
*   **LME Outlook**: Prices are expected to remain firm, trading in the $2,600 - $2,900/t range, supporting upstream margins.

### Domestic Market
*   **Demand Drivers**: India’s aluminium consumption is expected to grow at 8-10% CAGR, driven by government infrastructure spending (railways, power transmission) and the push for EVs.
*   **Competitive Landscape**:
    *   **Hindalco**: Best-in-class downstream mix (Novelis), lower leverage than Vedanta.
    *   **Vedanta**: Higher dividend yield but higher corporate governance noise and debt at the parent level.
    *   **NALCO**: Pure-play upstream, highly sensitive to alumina/aluminium prices, but lacks downstream value addition.
